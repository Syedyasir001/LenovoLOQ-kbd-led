--> This helps you to add different effects to your Lenovo LOQ's standard white LED keyboard.
--> If you have a different brand's laptop equipped with a standard white LED keyboard lights, you can still try running it.
--> This can be done on linux distros like arch, ubuntu, fedora etc.
--> It is completely safe to run.

# Instructions:
                                           **ONLY SUPPORTS LINUX**
1️⃣ Check If Your Keyboard Supports Brightness Control:
--> Firstly you need to check the brightness levels supported by your keyboard. This can be done by turning on the LEDs manually using the shortcut. In my case, the lights turn on by using 
    Fn+Space.You can cycle to different brightness levels such as low and high or low, medium and high in some laptops.


--> If you have two brightness levels then the scripts I have made will work perfectly fine.


--> If you have three brightness levels then the scripts will work but may skip a brightness level.


--> Copy the different scripts which have different effects to your terminal and run.


--> If you want to stop, Press Ctrl + C in the terminal.
            ENJOY!
